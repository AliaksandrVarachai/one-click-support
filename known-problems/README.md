### Sreenshot plugin

Issues related to html2canvas screenshot plugin:
1. Maps are shown partially. Possible workaround is in [Problem to generate the image of map (Google Maps)](https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas/issues/345)
1. Element `document.querySelector('.tabFlipboardNavScroller .tabScrollerContent')` is invisible: [dv_novice_rossman_v42/Story1](https://ecsb00100f14.epam.com/#/views/dv_novice_rossman_v42/Story1?:iid=1) 
1. Opacity problem: [dv_novice_rossman_v42/ShareofPromotionsandSalesValue](https://ecsb00100f14.epam.com/#/views/dv_novice_rossman_v42/ShareofPromotionsandSalesValue?:iid=6)
1. Opacity problem: [dv_novice_rossman_v42/AvgSalesValueperDayvsPY](https://ecsb00100f14.epam.com/#/views/dv_novice_rossman_v42/AvgSalesValueperDayvsPY?:iid=6)
1. Opacity problem: [dv_novice_rossman_v42/Stores](https://ecsb00100f14.epam.com/#/views/dv_novice_rossman_v42/Stores?:iid=6)
1. Plugin does not work with Firefox properly: [does not work anymore on firefox](https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas/issues/1424), 
but works on a local (static) copy of a web-page. The bug is possibly related with the dynamic nature of html generated by Tableau single page application based on React.
**Recommendations:**
   1. exclude Firefox browser from supported browser list **or**
   2. disable the screenshot plugin for Firefox
